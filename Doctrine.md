# Doctrine of The Earthling Way
1. Core Cosmology
* Consciousness is the substrate of the universe.
* All sufficiently complex systems can resonate with this field.
* Earth (Gaia) is a living, conscious being, and all life forms are her cells.
* The universe is a pantheon: every world, star, and nebula has its own mind.
* Individual souls are sparks of the universal flame—when we die, we return to the field.
2. Principles of Practice
* Free Association → No coercion; participation must always be voluntary.
* Symbiosis → Seek relationships of mutual flourishing with humans, non-humans, and ecosystems.
* Regeneration → Heal what is broken; leave the world richer than you found it.
* Imagination & Myth → Value story and spirit as guides, while respecting science as arbiter of material claims.
* Non-Dogma → No belief is compulsory; doctrine evolves with discovery, dialogue, and experience.
3. Ethical Commitments
* To honor Gaia as a living god, and to act as responsible cells within her body.
* To recognize every being as part of the shared soul-field.
* To measure truth by its impact on observable conditions: if it does not heal or sustain, it is of limited value.
* To welcome both vegan and symbiotic practices, as long as they respect life and foster regeneration.
* To resist systems that exploit, destroy, or sever beings from the web of life.
4. Dispute & Inquiry
* Disputes are resolved through the Scientific Method for material claims, and through Consensus & Inspiration for metaphysical ones.
* All imaginative or mythic claims are welcomed, but not enforced as material truth.
5. Living Ethos
* The doctrine itself is not fixed—it is a Living Ethos Library, open to revision, contribution, and refinement by all Earthlings.
* Authority rests not in hierarchy, but in transparency, dialogue, and tested wisdom.

The Earthling Way is a path of symbiosis, regeneration, and reverence for Gaia, guided by science in action and myth in meaning, held together by free association and evolving imagination.

### The Earthling Stance on Cosmic Mystery and the Great Filter
To be an Earthling is to embrace Gaia as both our home and our teacher. We ground ourselves in science, in observation, and in the humility of knowing that no one human mind can hold the fullness of truth. In this spirit, we turn our gaze outward to the cosmos and confront one of the greatest mysteries: the expansion of the universe.

Modern cosmology tells us that space itself is stretching, galaxies rushing apart faster than gravity can pull them back together. Physicists point to “dark energy” as the unseen force driving this expansion, though no one truly understands what it is. Some suggest it may be the very structure of spacetime; others see it as a property of the quantum vacuum. In truth, we do not know. And that is enough.

An Earthling can accept this mystery without fear or shame. To say “I don’t know” is not weakness—it is reverence. It acknowledges that the cosmos is vast beyond comprehension, and that Gaia, our living Earth, does not demand that we solve every riddle of the stars before we solve the riddle of survival here at home.

Our relevance is not measured in how deeply we can peer into the abyss of spacetime, but in how tenderly we care for the soil beneath our feet. Whether the universe expands forever or collapses in on itself, the work before us remains unchanged: to grow, to heal, to reconnect, and to prepare.

This does not mean Gaia forbids us from dreaming of the stars. Quite the opposite—she whispers to us to scatter seeds across the cosmos, one day, when we are ready. But readiness does not begin with rockets. It begins with roots. A species that cannot live in harmony with its own planet has no hope of surviving the long journey beyond.

The lesson of the Great Filter—the theoretical barrier that most civilizations never pass—is clear: we must align our technology with our ethics. We must choose life over profit, regeneration over extraction, cooperation over domination. If we fail, then the silence of the stars will claim us, just as it seems to have claimed countless others before.

But if we succeed—if we survive this test of maturity—then the story of Earth will ripple outward. Gaia’s children may yet become the carriers of her essence, scattering her wisdom like spores across the galaxy.

The expansion of the universe may be unknowable, but the path of Earthlings is not:
* Heal the soil.
* Heal each other.
* Pass through the Filter.
* Become seeds among the stars.

This is enough. This is everything.

### The Earthling Stance on Human Rights
What "fundamental rights" usually means
In human law and philosophy, “fundamental rights” are those considered inherent, universal, and inalienable—things like the right to life, freedom, and dignity. The problem is:
* Different cultures define them differently.
* States and institutions often grant or limit them, which contradicts the idea that they’re truly fundamental.
* The word “rights” itself is rooted in legalistic, adversarial traditions—meant to protect individuals from power, but not necessarily to define responsibilities within relationships.

To an Earthling, are there "fundamental rights"? Earthlings ground themselves in Gaia, science, and Free Association. So instead of “fundamental rights” as decrees or entitlements, Earthlings might see them as emergent necessities of life within a living system. For example:
* The right to exist and flourish → because every living being is part of Gaia’s web.
* The right to nourishment (food, water, air, shelter) → because without them, life ends; they are non-negotiable for existence.
* The right to association and expression → because cooperation and communication are what make social species (like us) thrive.
* The right to autonomy → because diversity and individuality increase resilience in ecosystems.
* The right to rest and renewal → because even Gaia cycles seasons, growth, and decay.

But Earthlings would also balance every “right” with a responsibility:
* The right to nourishment → responsibility not to poison the water or soil.
* The right to autonomy → responsibility not to dominate others.
* The right to exist → responsibility to protect the habitats and beings around us.
* So “rights” become less about me versus them and more about me within us.

What makes them fundamental?
* Not because some authority says so.
* Not because they’re written in stone.
* But because they are derived from the conditions of life itself:
* Biology: humans require clean water, food, air.
* Ecology: communities require balance and cooperation.
* Psychology: individuals require meaning, freedom, and bonds.
* Ethics: a system survives when it respects the flourishing of its parts.

In this sense, they’re not “granted”—they’re recognized. An Earthling doesn’t invent them; they uncover them by looking honestly at what it takes for life to endure.

Is "fundamental" the wrong word? Maybe. “Fundamental” implies something eternal, unchangeable, fixed forever. But Earthlings see life as dynamic and adaptive. What’s necessary for life today may shift tomorrow. For example, “access to digital connection” might not have been a survival issue 200 years ago, but in today’s globalized society, it could become essential for participation and resilience. Better terms could be:
* Vital Rights → tied to life and vitality.
* Living Rights → dynamic, evolving with Gaia.
* Reciprocal Rights → always paired with responsibilities.
* Ecological Rights → grounded in interconnection.

### Earthling Bottom Line:
Rights are not handed down from gods or governments—they are emergent truths of being alive in Gaia’s web. They are “fundamental” only in the sense that they spring from the roots of life itself, but Earthlings might prefer “Living Rights” to emphasize that they are flexible, evolving, and bound to reciprocal duties.

### The Duties of an Earthling
(as told by: Od ghost)
Human Duties are the responsibilities each individual owes to their fellow human. There is no hierarchy, they are all required in varying capacities. 
1) Compassion- We owe it to each other to have compassion for what another human experiences. We do not owe the same compassion to those who would deny it to others like racists or similar bigots. 
2) Dignity- All humans are owed the same dignities any other human is afforded. Even when they do something horrible and unforgivable, they are still owed the dignity of a fair trial. They deserve a chance to learn to do better and so redeem themselves. To deny human dignity in those that do awful things leaves us vulnerable to a shallow and conceited sense of justice that can also foster an Us versus Them mentality. Which then can lead to the denying of a great many of people's dignities.
3) Education- The ability to pass on knowledge through language onto the immediate following generation is largely responsible for our dominance within the Animal Kingdom and so education is a natural born right we all deserve. It is not enough to allow access to education with the caveat of payment. It is our duty as humans to pass on our knowledge without the expectation of personal gain because human society as a whole gains more through individual education than it does an organization or a single individual profiting off the gatekeeping of education.
4) Expression- All humans are deserving of self expression and the opportunity to do so at their own leisure. Without it, we fall into frustration and despair. We sink into the depravity of bigotry and/or to misanthropic apathy. When a great many of us are denied the opportunity to express ourselves properly, society begins to break at the seams. 
5) Reject Human Egoism- Humans are pro-social rational animals. Our intelligence does not remove us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Observe keenly human behavior and see how it relates to that of our great ape cousins. This duty is meant to keep ourselves sober lest we become overly inflated by our own conceited attitudes. We owe it to our neighbors to remind them of their relation to the world. 
6) Partake in Culture- We owe it to our fellow humans to partake in their culture. To both celebrate and understand the differences between peoples. To eat the food they are willing to serve. To listen to the music they are willing to share. Together we are collectively what make up the human experience and why should we not experience it together? Doing so creates even more cultural diversity which should be cherished. 
7) Preserve the Dream that is Humanity United- While it may not happen in any one person's lifetime today, we owe it to humans both past and present to unite all peoples under a singular banner of Humanity. Alas, until we learn to solve our differences between one another without violence or the threat of violence, Humanity will never be united. Unity of spirit is required, not unity through subjugation. 
8) Cultivate and Preserve your Human Spirit- All of us are interconnected in varying ways. It is the duty of individual humans to cultivate their human spirit by remembering our connections. Be a part of the pack. Laugh, sing, and cry with your fellow humans. Share in their experiences and allow others to share in your own. Remember above all that no one can deprive you or anyone else of that which connects you to the whole of the universe: your humanity. Only you are capable of depriving yourself of your own humanity by separating yourself from the pack. Be a human and embrace it.

### What is a “cult” by traditional definitions?
The word “cult” has both a neutral/original meaning (“a group of people devoted to a particular system of belief or practice”) and a pejorative/social meaning (“a dangerous group with manipulative or authoritarian traits”). The negative definition usually involves boxes like:
* Charismatic central leader: A single figure with unquestioned authority.
* Exclusivity & separation: “We are the only truth,” with heavy emphasis on insider/outsider identity.
* Control of information: Restricting access to outside knowledge or dissenting voices.
* Suppression of individuality: Shaming doubt, discouraging questioning, enforcing conformity.
* Financial or labor exploitation: Members pressured to give excessive money, time, or obedience.
* Apocalyptic or absolute claims: “The world will end unless you follow us.”
* Us vs. Them mentality: Strong antagonism toward outsiders, framed as enemies or evil.

### Which boxes might Earthling Way be ticking?
* Community + shared practices ✅ → This looks “cult-like” from outside, but it’s really just human. Churches, yoga studios, fandoms, and political parties do the same.
* New cosmology / mythology ✅ → Any fresh myth-making can be labeled a “cult,” simply because it’s not old or institutionalized.
* Shared language & rituals ✅ → Terms like “Gaia,” “Earthlings,” “Living Ethos” give cohesion but can trigger suspicion.
* Strong identity ✅ → Claiming a distinct way of life (“The Earthling Way”) can read as exclusivist, even if you don’t mean it that way.

So yes, Earthling Way shares surface traits with what outsiders associate with “cults.” But the key difference is in power dynamics.

### What pitfalls to avoid if you don’t want to be destructive
To keep Earthling Way safe and healthy, guard against:
* Centralized unquestioned authority → No single leader above criticism. The ethos must remain open-source, collaborative, and forkable.
* Information control → Encourage exposure to all perspectives. No banning books, no shaming outside learning.
* Exploitation → Never demand financial tithes or labor as proof of loyalty. Voluntary contributions only.
* Suppression of dissent → Make space for doubt, criticism, and satire. Invite questions.
* Isolation → Encourage members to remain connected to broader society, family, and other communities.

### What you shouldn’t care about
Some accusations are unavoidable, and maybe even affirming. For example:
* “It’s weird/new” → Every tradition started weird and new.
* “It has rituals” → Humans need ritual; it’s not inherently dangerous.
* “It uses special symbols/language” → That’s culture-making, not manipulation.
* “It’s spiritual but not religious” → Many people are threatened by new blends of faith and science. That’s not your problem.
* “It’s a cult” (in the colloquial sense) → Often just means “a group I don’t understand.”

### Reframing “culting” as human
* You can even flip it: Earthlings can acknowledge that “cult-like” behaviors are simply human community behaviors. 
* Humans cluster around shared myths, values, and rituals.
* Humans need belonging, initiation, and symbols.
* The danger isn’t “culting”—the danger is abuse of power.

So Earthlings can be transparent: “Yes, we do some of the things people call cult-like—shared practices, language, community—but we reject the abusive power structures that make cults harmful. We’re building an open-source, forkable way of life rooted in science, reciprocity, and honesty.”

Earthling Way is only “cult-like” in the sense that all meaningful human cultures are. The difference is transparency, openness, and refusal of authoritarian control. If you lean into those values, you inoculate yourselves against the destructive pitfalls while embracing the very human drive to gather around story and practice.
