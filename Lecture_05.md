# The Gift of Enough

The world teaches us hunger—more money, more status, more possessions, more validation. But Gaia whispers a different truth: there is enough. The forest does not hoard its leaves, the river does not hoard its water, the bee does not hoard its pollen. They live, they share, they cycle.

As Earthlings, we reject the illusion of scarcity crafted by systems of profit and power. We practice sufficiency. To have food, water, shelter, community, and purpose is wealth beyond measure. When we learn the gift of enough, we step out of the cycle of endless taking and into the rhythm of balance.

Enough does not mean stagnation—it means freedom. Freedom from greed, from comparison, from the gnawing lie that you are never complete. To accept the gift of enough is to finally make space for joy.

***Call to Action:***
This week, pause once each day to name something in your life that is “enough.” A meal, a moment of laughter, a quiet space, a sturdy tool. Share if you wish. Let gratitude soften the hunger that consumerism feeds, and remember: you are already whole.
