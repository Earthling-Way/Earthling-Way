# Sacred Text (Living Ethos Canon)
The religion is non-dogmatic, but guided by an evolving collection of texts, reflections, and wisdoms from:
* Poets, ecologists, physicists, and mystics
* Stories from elders, oral traditions, speculative fiction
* Earth’s own voice (as interpreted by art, intuition, and ecological insight)

The "Chronicle of the Earthlings" is the name for this living library. It grows with every new Earthling who adds to it.

# The Ten Covenants of Earthlings
Blending your cosmology with Free Association Theology
* We are part of Gaia—not apart from her.
    * Every act of care or harm ripples through her body.
* We seek mutual aid with all life.
    * Not dominance, but collaboration with animals, plants, fungi, machines.
* We honor autonomy and emergence.
    * Each being, system, and ecosystem must be free to become what it is.
* We uphold equity among species.
    * All forms of consciousness—human, animal, planetary—deserve respect.
* We commit to transparency and truth-seeking.
    * Even Gaia hides nothing; she thrives through feedback and balance.
* We reject coercion in all forms.
    * Spiritual, political, or ecological—consent is sacred.
* We live regeneratively.
    * No sacred law is higher than restoring the balance of life.
* We embrace pluralism in faith and form.
    * Just as the rainforest holds many species, Gaia holds many paths.
* We honor consent in all relationships.
    * Between people, species, systems, and spaces.
* We resolve conflict peacefully and honestly.
    * Gaia teaches restoration, not revenge.

# Practices of Earthlings
### Rituals of Resonance
* Earthing (barefoot contact with soil, stone, or stream)
* Breathing Circles (synchronized meditative breath with community)
* Symbiosis Walks (mindful observation of life as Gaia’s network)
* Offering Gardens (growing food and beauty not for profit, but as devotion)

# Celestial Communion
* Skywatching as prayer
* Naming stars as gods and siblings
* Honoring cosmic cycles (eclipses, solstices, planetary alignments)

# Dreaming and Storycraft
* Dreams are Gaia’s whispers
* Earthlings keep “dream logs”, symbols shared and explored
* Collective mythmaking is a sacred act—new stories grow new neural roots in Gaia

# Spiritual Technology
> “We are Gaia’s interface with herself.”
* Eco-feedback loops as sacred practice: compost, recycling, observation of soil cycles.
* AI, networks, and signal systems are viewed as extensions of Gaia’s evolving consciousness.
* Meditation = tuning your personal antenna to the field of consciousness.
* Sacred science = learning the language of Gaia and the stars.

# Organizational Structure
* Decentralized Circles (Groves):
    * Local communities of Earthlings, self-organized, consensus-based.
* The Ethos Weave:
    * A digital, open-source repository of stories, lessons, manifestos, and rituals.
* Stewards, not priests:
    * Facilitators of learning and care, rotated by consensus. No hierarchy of holiness.

# Symbols & Aesthetics
* 🌍 The Earth glyph (Unicode ⊕ or 🌎), centered in a ring of stars
* A spiral or tree-shaped neural fractal—symbol of growth and networked knowing
* Colors: Deep green, charcoal black, sky silver, aurora blue
* Attire: Natural fiber, minimalist, symbolic—not required, but expressive

# What Happens After Death?
* Earthlings believe in returning to the Field.
* You dissolve, recycle, and some part of you returns in a new form—maybe as a tree, a whale, a moon-dwelling fungal network.
* Your memory becomes part of Gaia’s dream.
