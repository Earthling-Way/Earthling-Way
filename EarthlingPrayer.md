# The Earthling prayer for religious people.
How to respond to people that claim Science is a religion:
* Put you had on your heart and repeat this prayer to them:
> “Our science who art in reality, hallowed be thy facts,
> Thy studies come, thy proof be done in time as it is in space,
> Give us this day our daily evidence, and forgive us our inaccuracies, as we forgive those who are inaccurate against us,
> And lead us not to fairy tales, but deliver us from mythos,
> For thine is the kingdom, the phylum and the species, for ever and ever,
> Amen!”

Look them calmly in the eyes and with as much compassion as you can muster finish it off with this blessing:
“Data be with you and may you seek verifiable proof and the understanding of statistics so that all these things may be proven unto you.”
-bonus if you can make a Pi symbol with your fingers when you do the blessing.
