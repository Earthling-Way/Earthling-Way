# Draft Bylaws of the Earthling Order
## Article I. Purpose
The Earthling Order exists to promote the Living Ethos, protect and restore Gaia, and cultivate community through education, mutual aid, and sustainable practices.

## Article II. Membership
* Students of Gaia
    * Anyone seeking to learn.
    * No obligations beyond curiosity and respect.
    * Encouraged to explore the Living Ethos, attend gatherings, and ask questions.
* Stewards of Gaia
    * Active participants committed to daily practice and community support.
    * Can lead local rituals, host discussions, and help mentor Students.
    * Expected to contribute time, skills, or resources toward collective projects.
* Council Stewards
    * Elected by local Stewards for a fixed term (typically 3 years).
    * Represent their community’s voice in wider decisions.
    * No permanent authority — must step down after term ends and may be recalled and replaced by vote of the Stewards he represents at any time.
* Oracles of Gaia
    * Recognized by consensus as deep thinkers and guides.
    * Serve as advisors to Councils, not rulers.
    * Can be recalled if they abuse trust or drift from the Ethos.

## Article III. Governance
* Consensus First: Decisions made through consensus whenever possible.
* Fallback: If consensus fails, a 2/3 vote of Council Stewards decides.
* Rotation: No one may hold the same Council position for consecutive terms.
* Transparency: All financial, legal, and organizational documents are open to members.

## Article IV. Safeguards Against Corruption
* No paid clergy; stipends only for basic living expenses if needed for full-time service.
* Rotating leadership to prevent entrenchment.
* Local chapters are autonomous but bound by the Living Ethos.
* Disputes resolved through restorative justice practices.

### The Earthling Way – Protocol for Disputes and Inquiry
1. ***Ground Rule: Shared Reality***: All Earthlings agree that we live in a shared material world, with observable conditions that affect our lives. Disputes must ultimately be resolved by reference to material effects in this world (food, water, energy, ecosystems, justice, well-being).
2. ***Three-Tier Framework for Ideas***: When a disagreement arises, ideas are placed into one of three categories:
    * Empirical → Claims testable in observable conditions.
        * Example: “This soil practice increases crop yield.”
        * Test: Experiment, measurement, replication.
    * Metaphysical / Mythic → Claims not directly testable, but offering meaning, imagination, or moral guidance.
        * Example: “Gaia dreams through us.”
        * Value: Inspiration, cohesion, ethical framing.
    * Speculative / Fictional → Purely imaginative, acknowledged as story or symbol.
        * Example: “There are invisible dragons in my garden.”
        * Value: Entertainment, metaphor, teaching tool.
    * Note: Categories are not hierarchical. Each has value, but they are applied differently.
3. Dispute Protocol
    * Clarify the Claim
        * Write it clearly. Is it about reality (empirical), meaning (metaphysical), or imagination (speculative)?
    * Identify Stakes
        * Does this claim affect how we live, build, or care for Earth?
        * If yes → empirical evidence required.
        * If no → it may remain in mythic/speculative space.
    * Test Empirical Claims (Scientific Method)
        * Hypothesis → Experiment → Observe → Peer Review → Repeat.
        * If reproducible and observable → claim is upheld.
        * If not → claim is rejected (but may remain as myth/fiction).
    * Hold Space for Metaphysical Claims
        * Metaphysical ideas cannot be “proven,” but may be embraced if they inspire ethical action and do not contradict observed reality.
        * Example: “The river is a spirit” may not be empirically testable, but if it leads to better care for the river, it holds social and spiritual value.
    * Acknowledge Fictional Claims
        * Fictional or imaginative claims are preserved as art, myth, and play, but not used as grounds for real-world decisions.
4. Conflict Resolution
    * If two Earthlings disagree, they follow these steps:
        * Categorize the claim (empirical, metaphysical, speculative).
        * If empirical → resolve by science.
        * If metaphysical → resolve by consensus: Does it inspire good action?
        * If speculative → treat as story, not doctrine.
    * Final Principle:
        * If it cannot change the world we live in together, it cannot divide us.
5. Why This Matters
    * This protocol prevents:
        * Dogma (forcing myth into material truth).
        * Reductionism (dismissing imagination outright).
        * Division (fighting over what cannot be tested).
    * It allows Earthlings to hold science as compass, myth as map, and story as song—all valid, but used in the right context.

1. Ground Rule: Shared Reality
All Earthlings agree that we live in a shared material world, with observable conditions that affect our lives.
Disputes must ultimately be resolved by reference to material effects in this world (food, water, energy, ecosystems, justice, well-being).

2. Three-Tier Framework for Ideas
When a disagreement arises, ideas are placed into one of three categories:
Empirical → Claims testable in observable conditions.
* Example: “This soil practice increases crop yield.”
* Test: Experiment, measurement, replication.

Meaning-Making / Mythic → Claims not directly testable, but offering shared meaning, imagination, or moral guidance.
* Example: “Gaia dreams through us.”
* Value: Inspiration, cohesion, ethical framing.

Speculative / Fictional → Purely imaginative, acknowledged as story or symbol.
* Example: “There are invisible dragons in my garden.”
* Value: Entertainment, metaphor, teaching tool.

Note: Categories are not hierarchical. Each has value, but they are applied differently.
