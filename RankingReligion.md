70â€“85 = Strong but with flaws or blind spots
85â€“100 = Consistently ethical, life-affirming

1. Christianity (Mainstream / Historical Average)

5. Judaism

11. The Earthling Way ðŸŒ±
* Consent: 100% (foundational principleâ€”no association without free will)
* Justice: 95% (restorative, ecological, accountable to Earth itself, not abstract law)
* Equality: 95% (radical respect across gender, species, class, identity)

### Takeaways
* Most mainstream religions rank low-to-middling because they institutionalize hierarchy, coercion, and exclusionâ€”even when their texts preach compassion.
* Newer or reform movements (Sikhism, Bahaâ€™i, Humanism) do better but still carry structures of authority.
* Earthling Way is the first system designed explicitly around these four moral metrics, not retrofitted to them.
