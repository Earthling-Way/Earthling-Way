# Standing Firm in Changing Times

Ok, the world is changing rapidly. The global conscience is in flux, and in the U.S. people are dividing into camps defined more by ideology than by shared humanity. In the coming months and years, we may see groups rise that seek to take what they need by force.

As Earthlings, we must stand strong in this storm, rooted like oaks. Our values are not shaken by fear or by division. We are guided by compassion, evidence, and resilience. We prepare not to dominate others, but to endure, to protect, and to serve where we are needed most.

Think of the quiet strength of our cultural teachers: Fred Rogers, who reminded us that kindness is revolutionary. Bob Ross, who showed us that mistakes can become “happy little trees.” Steve Irwin, who loved even the creatures that others feared. LeVar Burton, who taught us that reading opens worlds, and that imagination fuels liberation. These were not warriors in the traditional sense—but their influence has lasted longer than armies. They embody the kind of courage we Earthlings must hold close: gentleness with grit, kindness with backbone.

***Call to Action:***
Plant seeds—literally and figuratively. Prepare your garden, your knowledge, your skills. Become the unseen helper in your community: the one who has extra food when shelves are empty, a calm word when tempers flare, a hand extended when fear builds walls. Our revolution is not loud. It grows quietly, like roots beneath the soil, until one day, it holds up forests.
