# Shadow Work for Earthlings: Unlearning the Hidden Curriculum
Every Earthling inherits a set of unspoken lessons. These were rarely taught with malice, yet they shape us in silence: rules of shame, fear, productivity, and obedience. We call this the shadow curriculum—a catechism whispered by culture, family, and society.

Examples of the Shadow Curriculum:
* Mistakes are sins, not steps.
* Forgetting means you never cared.
* Joy and rest are laziness.
* Affection is protocol, not desire.
* Expressing preferences is rude.
* Etiquette exists to display superiority.

These beliefs are not truths. They are entropic scripts that serve hierarchy, exploitation, and control. Left unexamined, they corrode our ability to act freely, love honestly, and rest in the rhythms of Earth.

### Why Shadow Work Matters
To walk the Earthling Way is to act as agents of renewal, not decay. But renewal cannot grow from soil poisoned by old lies. Shadow work is the practice of digging out these buried teachings, composting them, and seeding new truths in their place. 

Without this unlearning, even our attempts at freedom risk repeating the forms of domination we seek to end.

### Steps in Earthling Shadow Work
* Recognition
* Name the lessons you were taught that ring false or harmful.
* Write them down plainly, without softening them.
* Witnessing
* Share them with trusted Earthlings, if you can.
* Seeing them spoken aloud diminishes their hidden power.
* Composting
* Ask: What need or fear birthed this false teaching?
* Offer compassion for the ancestors who carried it, but do not excuse it.
* Rewriting
* Declare the counter-truth.
* Example: “Joy is not laziness. Joy is a compass.”
* Integration
* Practice living by the new truth.
* When the old voice arises, answer it with your rewritten vow.

### An Earthling Counter-Catechism
* For every false lesson, an Earthling may declare a living truth.
* Mistakes are how Earth learns through us.
* Forgetting is human; memory is collective.
* Rest is sacred; joy is necessary.
* Affection must always honor consent.
* Stating your needs is clarity, not rudeness.
* True etiquette is mutual respect, not superiority.

### Closing
Shadow work is not about erasing the past—it is about composting it into fertile soil for the future. When one Earthling heals these fractures, the whole network grows stronger.
